potential project plan 

1. Define the Core Requirements

Target Users: Clearly identify the user types, such as patients, caregivers, and medical professionals.
Monitoring Metrics: List what muscle activity data needs to be tracked (e.g., EMG data, muscle strength, range of motion).
Functional Scope: Determine which tasks will be monitored and how the data will be visualized or analyzed.
Hardware Integration: Identify the specific wrist-worn sensor you will use and ensure it can communicate with your app.

2. Data Collection and Sensors

Select a Wearable Device: Choose or develop a wrist-worn wearable device that can collect muscle activity data (e.g., EMG sensors, accelerometers).
API/SDK Integration: Ensure the device has an API or SDK for easy integration with your web app.
Data Sampling: Decide how frequently data will be collected and what kind of data (raw, processed) will be sent to the app.

3. Backend Development

Choose a Technology Stack:
Backend Language: Consider Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), or other appropriate languages.
Database: Choose between SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for storing user data and activity logs.
APIs: Set up APIs to receive data from the wearable device and send it to your database.
Data Processing: Implement algorithms to process raw muscle activity data (e.g., filtering noise, segmenting tasks).
Data Storage: Create models to store raw and processed data, patient profiles, and activity logs.

4. Frontend Development

UI/UX Design:
Design an intuitive interface for patients to view their progress, set goals, and monitor daily activity.
Design a separate dashboard for healthcare providers to monitor multiple patients.
Web Technologies: Choose a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for building responsive and interactive UIs.
Data Visualization: Use libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or Plotly to display charts and progress over time (e.g., muscle activity graphs).
